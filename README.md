# Hi there, I'm [einsJannis](https://einsjannis.dev)

I'm a self thaught programmer from Switzerland.

My thing is to start way too ambitious projects which are completely useless because they either already exist in some form or get abandoned before I finish them.

I love Kotlin and Rust but I have use a bunch of other languages before like the following:

 - Java
 - Java/TypeScript
 - Python
 - Shell-Script (POSIX Shell)
 - C
 - C++
 
I am also daily driving Arch Linux and am thus quite agile with things related to Linux.

I have am very interested in how code can let a computer do stuff and thus I love to explore how libraries, protocols, compilers, technolegies and the underlying hardware works.

## Education

 - Gymnasiale Matura with focus on physics and applied mathematics, Kantonsschule Alpenquai, Lucerne, Switzerland June 2022

## Employment

I'm currently looking for a job.

## Latest and greatest projects

NOTE: I took a break during my final Matura exams and for some time afterwards. After my break I started to work on a small comertial project, which I can't publish on Github, which lead to my lack of activity on here.
