# Hi there, I'm [einsJannis](https://einsjannis.dev)

I'm a programmer from Switzerland.

My thing is to start way too ambitious projects which are completely useless because they either already exist in some form or I never finish them.

## Employment

I'm jobless and in highschool till summer 2022, but if you want to hire me: I'd love to get a job.
