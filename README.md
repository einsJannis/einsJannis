# Hi there, I'm [Jannis](https://einsjannis.dev)

Avid Linux User and Programmer passionate about understanding technology from the ground up.

Currently studying Computer Science at [ETH Zurich](inf.ethz.ch).

I enjoy sharing my small projects here whenever time allows. Unfortunately, my schedule is quite busy at the moment, but I look forward to sharing more code on here in the future.

And even when I have time, I mostly work on stuff for [VIS](vis.ethz.ch) or [Bastli](bastli.ethz.ch) which are hosted on [the ETH gitlab](gitlab.ethz.ch) but most of my projects there aren't public (yet).

## Education

 - Gymnasiale Matura with focus on physics and applied mathematics, Kantonsschule Alpenquai, Lucerne, Switzerland (June 2022)
 - Bachelor in Computer Science, ETH Zurich (ongoing)
